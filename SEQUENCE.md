In PostgreSQL, a **sequence** is a database object that generates a sequence of unique integers. Here's what you need to know:

1. **Creating a Sequence:**
   - You can create a sequence using the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE SEQUENCE my_sequence;
     ```
   - This creates a sequence named `my_sequence`.

2. **Usage:**
   - Sequences are often used to generate unique identifiers for primary keys in tables.
   - You can use the `nextval` function to get the next value from a sequence.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT nextval('my_sequence');
     ```

3. **Parameters:**
   - You can customize the sequence using parameters like `INCREMENT BY`, `MINVALUE`, `MAXVALUE`, and `START WITH`.
   - For instance:
     ```sql
     CREATE SEQUENCE my_sequence
         INCREMENT BY 1
         MINVALUE 1
         MAXVALUE 1000
         START WITH 1;
     ```

4. **Temporary Sequences:**
   - You can create temporary sequences that exist only for the current session.
   - Use `TEMPORARY` or `TEMP` keywords.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TEMPORARY SEQUENCE temp_sequence;
     ```

Remember that sequences are handy for generating unique values, especially for primary keys.
