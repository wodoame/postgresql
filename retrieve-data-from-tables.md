To retrieve data from a PostgreSQL database, you can use the `SELECT` statement in SQL. Here's a basic example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
```

This command will fetch all columns from the specified table. If you need to retrieve specific columns, replace `*` with the column names:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM your_table_name;
```

Remember to replace `your_table_name` with the actual name of your table and `column1`, `column2` with the actual column names you wish to retrieve.

If you're using a programming language like Python, you would use a library like `psycopg2` to execute this SQL command and fetch the results. Would you like an example in Python or another language?
Here's a basic Python example using the `psycopg2` library to retrieve data from a PostgreSQL database:

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect to your postgres DB
conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=your_dbname user=your_username password=your_password")

# Open a cursor to perform database operations
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute a query
cur.execute("SELECT column1, column2 FROM your_table_name")

# Retrieve query results
records = cur.fetchall()

for record in records:
    print(record)

# Close communication with the database
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

Make sure to replace `your_dbname`, `your_username`, `your_password`, `column1`, `column2`, and `your_table_name` with your actual database name, user credentials, and table details.
